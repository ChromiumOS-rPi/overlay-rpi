    # After write image to SD card, the 2nd GPT table/header are at the middle
    # of the disk, as the image is usually smaller than the capacity of the card.
    # The ChromeOS cgpt repair command can move them to the end of the disk but
    # later when running cgpt add command it won't allow expanding the partition
    # size beyond the last sector of the original image.
    # A possible guess is that cgpt repair command doesn't update the LBA# of
    # the 2nd table/header recorded in the primary header. This cause cgpt add
    # command (mistakenly) to think the expansion would overwrite the 2nd GPT
    # table/header (that looks like were still in the middle of the disk).
    # Thus sgdisk is used instead as it does the job perfectly.
    #
    /usr/sbin/sgdisk -e $root_disk

    # 2nd GPT table/header are at the end of the disk and occupy 32+1 sectors.
    # So the new partition can't take all spare space to the end of the disk.
    # Minus 33 sectors should be enough but a bit more won't hurt.
    #
    /usr/bin/cgpt add -i 1 -s $(($last_sec - $start_sec - 10240)) $root_disk

    # Tell the kernel to pick up the new partition size
